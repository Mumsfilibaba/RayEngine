TODO:
-DX12CommandList - Create a commandlist (Bundle allocator and commandlist - can create one for compute and one for graphics)
-DX12 - Dynamic uploadheap - Resize when needed
-Generate MipMaps
-Swapchain Resize
-Create Constantbuffer in DX11Shader for shaderconstants
-DX12 - Use AdapterFlags for descrete and integrated graphicscards, find out how to do this in directx, maybe winapi? Does not matter since directx only exists on windows anyway
-DX12 - Swapchain flags for usage, format, count etc

-Constantbuffer, Sampler, Textures DX11, DX12, Vulkan
-Render triangle Vulkan
-Implement OpenGL
-Swapchain Fullscreen

-DX12 - Check tearing support - Vulkan (if supported by the API)
-DX12 - Setup breakpoints when errors occurs
-Create rendertargets for swapchain during creation?

-ITexture - GetType
-DX11/DX12 - Bufferusage flags
-DX11 - Static Samplers must be bound from 0 to n (in a single range), should be possible to not do this (DX11StaticSamplerRange?)

-Vulk - Create dummy surface and search for correct formats etc
-TextureLoader needs to be updated with the new formats
-Add p for pointers
-Controller support

-Virtual Filesystem
-Aquire pointers for native window etc
-Check if system supports vulkan in factory
-ANativeWindow pointer in AndroidWindowImpl
-Save current windowpointer (AndroidWindowImpl*) so events can be sent directly to it


For later:
-All formats in DX12, DX11 and Vulkan should be supported
-Error-Codes
-String-Class
-Queue-Class
-Vector-Class
-Hash-Table-Class
-Thread-Class
-Mutex-Class
-Fix deallocation of androidappstate in ondestroy
-Math SIMD (Vec3, Mat3, ColorF), Quaternion, ARM Neon support
-Android Socket Impl
-Finish socketimpl Win32, start on android
-Threadsafe logging
-Log should contain a circulararray so that when maxcount is recived, the first message is replaced with the new one
